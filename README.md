### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

A curious engineer who loves writing code that talks to both **humans** and **machines**.  

Currently working as an **IoT Engineer at Zoho**, where I:

- Build systems that connect machines, microcontrollers, and cloud platforms  
- Develop **adapter plugins for industrial protocols** (like Modbus, OPC, MTConnect, S7, etc.)  
- Create **custom Node-RED Plugins** for industrial workflows  
- Work closely on **real-time data pipelines**, monitoring, and edge logic  
- Build **custom-tailored features** for frontend client applications to support industrial use cases


When I’m not wiring up sensors or pushing commits, I’m probably experimenting with product ideas, exploring edge tech, or guiding a few devs on their learning path.
